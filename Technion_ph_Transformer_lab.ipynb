To measure the phase of the current, connect channel 2 of the Scope in parallel to the voltmeter which measures $I_p$ (see Figure 11). The voltmeter has a small internal resistance: ~ 0.1Ω and if the voltage is measured on the voltmeter, then this voltage will be proportional to the current, for example, it will have the same phase. In this manner, the phase of the current can be measured."
